You should be able to just clone this repository and open it in Finder, and it will install the workflow for you.

Usage:

 1. Select the text of a URL in any app (this step is not necessary for URLs that are already links, such as in Slack messages)
 2. Right click.
 3. Then click the "Services" menu item, then "Open in Tweetbot", and it will open that URL in Tweetbot for Mac.
 
 This workflow uses AppleScript code from [Federico Viticciâ€™s article on converting Twitter URLs to Tweetbot links](http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/convert-twitter-com-urls-to-tweetbot-links/).
